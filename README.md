# Project Overview

This project is a multi-component robotics system composed of:

* **Macbook Air**: Sends commands and receives telemetry.
* **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as a relay node, forwarding commands to Arduino and telemetry back to the Mac.
* **Arduino 1**: Controls motors and ultrasonic sensors.
* **Arduino 2**: (Planned) Will handle encoders and possibly MPU6050 sensor input.

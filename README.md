# Pi–Arduino Robot Car
*A Pi Aurduino Robot that navigates, maps, and streams video.*

This project implements a small robot car built on the **ELEGOO Smart Robot Car Kit V4.0**, integrating a **Raspberry Pi** and **two Arduino microcontrollers**.

### Arduino's
- Code is written in Arduino coding format with standard libraries and some custom header files to clean up main loop. During integrating and building process, there are a series of **test_scripts** to load onto test Arduino's to test the Pi scripts without needing all sensors.
- **Elegoo Uno** Reads JSON input from Pi and sends PWM values to the 4 motors. The Elegoo Motor Shield actually only has 2 inputs for 4 motors (left and right). The motor PWM is then reported back to the Pi in a JSON format.
- **Nano** Continously reads the sensor data from the ultrasonic sensors, rear wheel encoders, and magnemeter and then sends it in a JSON format over serial to the Pi.

### Raspberry Pi
- Raspberry Pi OS
- Runs a Docker container that hosts python scripts to control and monitor motor and sensor hardware and report telemetry to the laptop.
- Basic obstacle avoidance by constantly checking ultrasonic distance then commanding motors a direction opposite of detected object
- Streams USB camera over unicast TCP to control laptop. Multicast will be used if more than 1 client in the future subscribes.
- udev rules set for each Arduino so that every time container or Pi is rebooted, consistent port mapping

### Control Laptop
- Runs a Tkinter GUI to send commands, monitor telemetry, and draws a block occupancy map of where robot has been.

## Next Steps (as of 10/22/2025)
- Add ability for GUI to send coordinates to robot to navigate to. The robot has rough data of where it's been and how far it's gone (rough is probably an understatement) so this can data can be used to approximate where to go given a set of coordinates.
- Add second Pi Arduino Bot to follow the main bot given the mapping data main bot sends
- Vision based navigation
